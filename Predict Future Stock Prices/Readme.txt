Project: Tesla Stock Prediction with Random Forest

This script downloads Tesla (TSLA) stock data using yfinance (2022–2025).  
It trains a RandomForestRegressor to predict the next day’s closing price.  
Performance is evaluated with Mean Squared Error and results are plotted.  
Future improvements include adding lag features and technical indicators.
